# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL & Tableau

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data using SQL to extract insights on infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress. The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, and vaccinations from different countries and continents. The results are visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard to better understand trends and patterns.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze COVID-19 infection rates and mortality rates across different locations.
- Compare total cases against total population to determine infection percentages.
- Identify countries and continents with the highest death tolls.
- Track global vaccination progress and its impact on infection rates.
- Create SQL views for efficient data storage and visualization.

## Tools Used
- **SQL Server** for data extraction and transformation.
- **Tableau** for interactive data visualization.
